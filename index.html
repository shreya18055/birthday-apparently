        <h2>Apparently not a special day so ok</h2>
        <p>We're so NOT excited to celebrate with you cuz you're mean af choose an option below to get started if you want or fuck off nobody cares</p>
        <button class="button" onclick="document.getElementById('message').style.display='block'">See Messages</button>
        <div id="message">Ok jokes apart. I've known you just for a while now, like only 3 months, but definitely feels longer. Still don't understand how we're the same people because I cannot think of one common thing apart from what we do, at this point I'm just rephrasing whatever you said just to make this big cuz you get annoyed and yea. Right so firstly, thank you for listening to me yapping random shit and thanks for being there when I needed someone to talk to. You're nice 10/100 and mean 90/100 but for some weird reason it's better off when you're mean. Secondly, I don't think I've ever said this but from what I've seen in the last 3 months, you're an amazing friend, you're there for all of your friends whenever they need you and you probably are the best therapist, ego boost but vechiko maaaaybe you deserve it. I don't want to make this too long because you don't like long messages but put up with this because I want to send ok bye. Finally, happy birthday, I know you don't like making a big deal out of  birthdays so the least I could do was this, sorry if it's crappy, last minute stuff I couldn't think of anything else. I hope you tick all your to-do lists and satisfy your curious adventurous self and I also hope you continue to get excited seeing cute cats, rabbits, pretty skies and all wholesome things. Continue being confused af and I hope you succeed in everything you ever want to do and become less lazy thanks. Ok idhukumela can't be nice to you, I'm done bye I hope this kutti thing brought a smile on your face</div>

        <h2>About Section</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone, I am adhavan suresh. I mostly forget my identity cuz i have amnesia so dont expect me to remember anything, I am dumb like that, but i will obviously remember a random thing happened to you on a random fucking thursday. I think i'm intimidating but i am a very difficult human to deal with because if you're mad at me, I will have zero clue. I can talk to you about literally anything everything something and nothing but cannot read paragraphs. I am so smart and so dumb at the same time. I love deep philosophical conversations or random debates but just don't make me read paragraphs. Basketball is quite literally my only love but i will cheat on basketball with muns sometimes although i do not like being called as a MUN guy. I will spend an entire night reading about nuclear physics if i want but if you text me on whatsapp I'll ghost you. I use cheesy unfunny one liners for no reason sometimes, deal with it if you want to. 5'5 21 old man with 2969832 personalities signing off. boobies.</p>
